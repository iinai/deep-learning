# Deep Learning Repository

## Overview

This repository contains task sets 1-3 of the Deep Learning course as well as a small project that seems to bring together the things learned in the course.

The exercise in section 4 is a cat or dog classifier. It is a neural network that classifies pictures of cats and dogs. A website has been built for Neuroverk using Flask, as well as basic HTML and CSS.
